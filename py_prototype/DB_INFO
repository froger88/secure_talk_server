Q1. Why redis?
A1. It is fast, we do not have so much data, and eventually lost of
    some of data (or even all) is not so painfull

Q2. If not available
A2. No possibility to join existing conversation

Q3. SPOF?
A3. Yes. It is SPOF, but it is enough for prototype. In future
    there will be few instances of REDIS and possible some built-in
    cache solutions to minimize SPOF size of this part
